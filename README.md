# AI-Powered Stock Screener and Advisory Platform

## Overview

The AI-Powered Stock Screener and Advisory Platform is a full-stack application that allows users to screen and analyze stocks using natural language queries. The system converts user queries into structured database queries using an AI-based parser and DSL (Domain Specific Language) compiler, executes them on financial data, and returns filtered stock results.

The platform also includes portfolio tracking, watchlist management, alerts, search history, and interactive financial dashboards.
